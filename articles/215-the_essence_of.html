       <p>Wednesday dinnertime: I am by myself. I don't want to eat alone, so I play Cal Newport's Deep Questions podcast. Today Cal is interviewing a friend of his that wrote two fascinating books called Essentialism and Effortless. Essentialism is the disciplined pursuit of less and Effortless makes it easier to do those essential pursuits.<p>
       <p>Essentialism is an idea that attracted me for some time. I noticed many times that trying to do too much was preventing me from both being happy and doing what mattered to me. Would not it be awesome - I thought - if achieving more and being happier required doing <i>less</i>?<p>
       <p>That's a no brainer, right? It would be totally awesome. So let's be essential, I thought as I finished eating, stopped the episode and sat on the couch. So, I had decided to practice essentialism, but I hadn't read the book, so I didn't know what that really meant. Mh, perhaps I can just make it harder for me to do <i>anything</i> - I thought. I can increase the bar for me to take <i>any</i> action.<p>
       <p>When I said "any action", I meant. So there I was, sitting on my couch, doing literally nothing. Quickly, everything was so quiet. No one was around me. No music, no sounds, apart from the refrigeration doing its thing. Alright, so I may as well close my eyes now. By now, it really felt exactly as doing meditation, even if I did not started any time or sat in a specific position.<p>
       <p>So what do I now? Mh, do I have enough motivation to do anything? Not really. Okay, perhaps I can just observe me being. Maybe I can even take the occasion to tidy up my mind a little. That sounds cool, let's do it. I have enough motivation to do it and I don't even need to take an action to start: two birds one stone.<p>
       <p>Okay, so what's up here? - I thought as I started observing myself. After a little observing, I discovered a few things.<p>
       <h2>Observing experience</h2>
       <p>The first thing I noticed was that there were essential two very distinct <i>forms</i> of my being<p>
       <p>1. On one hand, there is my physical being. I can feel this body. It is connected to the physical world. It is the <i>doer</i>, what every action I take must go through it. It cannot but but it that takes actions, and it needs to be compelled and convinced to do (especially since I decided to be an essentialist).<p>
       <p>2. On the other hand, there is this inner monologue that keeps going. Is it a voice? Not really, but it is mostly verbal. Sometimes it shows pictures and tactile sensations. Other times, it generates these weird unverbalised packed sequences of things (sometimes my girlfriend asks me what I am thinking about exactly in the middle of these mental sequences. Verbalising them to her, normally takes me about 10-50 times as much as they latest). Can I speak this monologue out, or write it? I assume I can, but actually I can't because either of those would involve passing by the physical being, so what would come out would be just a byproduct of this monologue.<p>
       <p>At first impression, these two forms seem to point to a Cartesian dualism. But actually, I don't think that's the case and I can explain why by describing the various modalities of being that (I observed) their interaction produce<p>
       <p>1. First, when I have a (somewhat) clear physical need, such as hunger, coldness or feel like my teeth are unpleasantly dirty (eh, I said somewhat) this quickly turns into my physical being taking action. The inner monologues is hardly involved at all. The stronger the physical need, the lower the intensity of my internal monologue. I guess there just isn't enough energy for me to both act effectively and think deeply. Sometimes (with the extreme case being breathing) taking action feels fully mindless.<p>
       <p>2. At the opposite end of the spectrum, when I take no action at all, I experience inactive thinking. During this, my internal monologue is rather hearable but, most notably and annoyingly, is unstoppable. I tried a bunch of times. It just does not shut up for more than 20 seconds at best. Also, while I can understand well what the monologue talks about, the order in which things come up makes no sense to me. It feels quite random. I like to think of this monologue as this actor on the stage playing a bunch of different characters by himself, changing voices, personalities and behaviours. Often, the monologue/actor starts building upon a certain element, but this "building upon" mechanism is also quite obscure to me.<p>
       <p>3. Besides doing and thinking, what's really interesting are what happens when I let inactive thinking carry on its thing of a while and I carefully observe it. Inactive thinking never really stays at it is and after an unclear amount of time it evolves to either of two possible states.<p>
       <p>4. One is what I call involved thinking. While inactive thinking is on, for some reason the physical being takes some interest in it and I start feeling more and more involved in the monologue. I may even forget about my physical being as I feel I (physically) am involved in the monologue. The items in the monologue (thoughts?) now cause me feelings. Normally, this eventually resolve in my physical being taking some action and entering an action state, where usually the internal monologue remains lightly involved and two of them (the physical being and the monologue) check-in with each other from time to time (funnily enough, as I wrote this paragraph I warmer and more physically active, even if my writing experience has not changed since the last paragraph. Writing this paragraph itself elicited a state of more involved thinking, in which I was already since my fingers have been stroking for quite some time)<p>
       <p>5. The other state in which inactive thinking evolves into is what I call detached thinking. When my physical being takes no interest in my internal monologues for some time, the monologue eventually degenerates. Items in its sequence become more and more abstract. There seems to be a spectrum of abstractness and detachment from the physical being that eventually lead me to fall asleep and dream (or to be a in a sleep-like state while awake). Most of the things that the monologue cooks up in this state seems hard to make sense of and I feel I cannot really bring them into the physical reality, for example by writing about them.<p>
       <h2>Reflections about modalities of being</h2>
       <p>Essentialism helped me realise that involved thinking seems having a kind of charge. The more I engage in it, the stronger it attracts inactive thinking. In order words, when I make it easier for my physical being to get involved in my inner monologue and take actions as a result of it, the more it does. It seems that acting upon one's thoughts is easier and faster the more one does it, which I guess has both good and bad consequences. Perhaps, what's physically happening is that my brain is lowering the threshold that the activation of firing neurons need to meet to cause action. Once that's done, action is easier and inactive thinking regularly leads to involved thinking, until we increase the threshold again. Sometime it seems to me that I set the threshold so low, that I stay in this involved thinking mode for days, where I think-act-think-act all the time and I never really experience inactive or detached thinking (other than when I sleep). This feels so draining. Meditation helps raise the activation threshold and come back to inactive and detached thinking, which is - I guess - why I like doing it so much.<p>
       <p>I am not sure if within any of the modalities I described there is such thing as "control". The physical being acts on a (somewhat) clear set of needs or as a result of involved thinking. The internal monologue is unstoppable and evolves spontaneously. It seems to me that my internal monologue behaves almost like natural evolution at million-times speed (like a time-lapse). Seed ideas, which I have no idea where they come from, keep evolving rapidly in all sorts of ways until some of them are picked up by the physical being or involved thinking. It feels as if thoughts are subject to a (natural) selection of which ones are more relevant to my physical (well)being.<p>
       <p>The "I" that is observing this happening seems to have no control on either the physical being or the unfolding of the inner monologue. So, things just "happen" to us? am I having a first-hand conscious experience of the non-existence of free will?<p>
       <p>In hindsight, most of what I observed seems quite obvious to me: we do stuff and we have thoughts, and there is some relationship between these two where sometimes they go hand in hand while other times they don't give a damn about each other. However, what I found particularly powerful of these observations was that my experience of them felt physical. I read a lot about feeling vs thinking in Kahneman's famous "Thinking Fast and Slow" and in the more recent beautiful depiction of the relationship between the Thinking Brain and the Feeling Brain by Mark Manson in "Everything Is Fucked". If I didn't self-deluded myself, observing this dichotomy first-hand during my evening was quite powerful.<p>
       <p>I think that memory and knowledge are of not exclusive access to my inner monologue (aka the Thinking Brain). My physical being (aka the Feeling Brain) can also access them. However, it seems that memory and knowledge are just storages where these two store each store their own stuff and both are unable to access and read the memories and knowledge of the other tenant (perhaps we need to reconfigure access policies?). Thus, this may be why having a semi-physical experience of a given concept feels very different then learning about it in a book. Practically speaking, I can say that having neatly experienced the difference between inactive, involved and detached thinking I am about to seek for them more <i>actively</i>, that is through the actions of my physical being. Even if notionally, I knew for some time that they should exist, since learnt about them in the books.<p>
